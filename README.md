# fast-check-tutorial

This is a tutorial to implement Property Based Testing for Node.js in Jest.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

These are some materials about Property Based Testing.

* [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) - QuickCheck is a library for random testing of program properties.
* [Hedgehog](https://hedgehog.qa/) - Hedgehog automatically generates a comprehensive array of test cases, exercising your software in ways human testers would never imagine.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
npm install
```

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

```
npm run test
```

The tests will also show the coverage of the codes, tests & test suites.
